            <div>
              <p>According internet: I am "an organism that turns coffee into software."</p>
              <p>I love programming and everything related with algorithms and data structures.
              Mainly I write JavaScript (Node.js) and C/C++ with goals in distributed systems
              that could help others in some way.</p>
              <p>In my free time, I like to read about code, society and other amazing histories.
              I also enjoy taking a ride on my bike or writing some bad-english stuff on this page.
              (sorry for that ):

            <a class="subtitle" href="//central-node.github.io/">Central Node: </a>
            <p>
              Central Node is our first experience creating a technology company.
              We try to be a distributed/self-motivated team that build awesome
              software in JavaScript, and it seems to work.
            </p>
            <p>
              At Central Node we enjoy working with new open source technologies,
              developing web, desktop and mobile solutions.
              <a href="//central-node.github.io/#three">Write us</a> if you need
              anything, we will be glad to build your software.

            <a class="subtitle" href="//pereirajs.org/">PereiraJS:</a>
            <p>
              This is a group of javascript users in Pereira, we started as a group of friends
              in the <a href="https://twitter.com/cronopio2"> Daniel's</a> house and today we celebrate
              monthly meetings with around 20 people.
            </p>
            <p>
              PereiraJS has been an amazing experience, I enjoy a lot learning (and teaching) about
              JavaScript. You feel being part of something giant: just look at
              <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/get-involved/events/">this</a>

            <a class="subtitle" href="//github.com/pin3da/Programming-contest">
              Solutions to programming contest & training:
            </a>
            <p>The most amazing thing, ever !</p>
            <p>I strongly recommend this to everybody, this really changed my life. I think this is
            important because you will learn things (usually very hard to learn) as self-motivation
            and discipline. There are A LOT of topics that will be missing or poorly taught in our education,
            but with constant practice you will be able to learn all of this.</p>

            <p>Besides this, I consider the programming contest is a lot of fun, I have known the most amazing
            people (currently some of my best friends) here. I also have known some places, with a little of luck
            you can travel a lot :D</p>
            <a class="subtitle" href="//github.com/pin3da/gplib"> GPlib : C++ Gaussian Process library:</a>
            <p>
            I worked on this project at my bachelor thesis with two friends and one master-legendary-sensei.
            We wrote a lot of C++ code to create a Gaussian Processes library, it would be great if any of
            you use it someday, just let us know.
