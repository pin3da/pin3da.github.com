# Some projects

## Solutions to programming contests

The most amazing thing, ever !

I strongly recommend this to everybody, this really changed my life. I think this
is important because you will learn things (usually very hard to learn) as
self-motivation and discipline. There are A LOT of topics that will be missing
or poorly taught in our education, but with constant practice you will be able
to learn all of them.

Besides this, I consider the programming contest is a lot of fun, I have known
the most amazing people (currently some of my best friends) here. I also have
known some places, with a little of luck you can travel a lot :D

[Here](https://github.com/pin3da/Programming-contest) is my repo with most of the solutions I've written.

## Local programming communities in Pereira

I've been coorganizer of [PereiraJS](https://pereirajs.org/) and
[Pereira Tech Talks](https://pereiratechtalks.com/) in the last years.

We organize monthly meetings and some "big events" each year with the goal of
teach people about programming and technology. We held events
such as ["the nodeschool day"](https://nodeschool.io/pereira/) and ["The angular weekend"](https://angular.pereirajs.org/)

## GPlib : C++ Gaussian Process library

 I worked on this project at my bachelor thesis with two friends and one
 master-legendary-sensei. We wrote a lot of C++ code to create a Gaussian
 Processes library, it would be great if any of you use it someday, just let us know.

 You can find the code [here](https://github.com/pin3da/gplib)
